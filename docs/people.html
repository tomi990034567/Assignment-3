                <p>Our team consists of four members - Lovisa, Ana-Maria, Emely and Thomas. We all have different educational and professional backgrounds that we are leveraging to complete our project. We had several meetings about the project work. Decisions were always made by the whole team. We used a google doc file to constantly brainstorm and communicate all our insights. Sharing the newest version of the website was always given.</p>

                <h3>The Work</h3>
                <p>Lovisa studied librarian science and has experience in datasets. She provided the initial dataset that we are using for our project. With her background working as a librarian, she has access to records of past projects conducted by researchers at her university. 
                Ana-Maria oversee the elements of the project. This includes making this course literature list more accessible for the algorithm and relevant for the algorithm. 
                Emely has been dividing her time between programming with Lovisa and helping curate project documentation. Her skills have helped ensure we have robust and organized records of our process. She made a comprehensive list of all the project requirements and established some of the keywords for our search.
                Thomas has studied marketing and communications previously. He has taken the lead on designing and building the front-end interface of our project website.
