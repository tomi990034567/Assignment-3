# Datalogical Thinking Project Group 4
Welcome to our project repository! This project aims to guide you through the process of conceptualizing, curating a dataset, designing an algorithm, and creating a small website to showcase our work. 

## Step 1: Conceptualization

The first step is to brainstorm with the team and decide what kind of data we're interested in and what we want to do with it. 

This includes:

Finding or conceptualizing an interesting dataset
Defining a specific problem or need for the data that can be resolved algorithmically
Modeling or fine-tuning the data to make it relevant for your algorithm

## Step 2: Curate The Dataset

This step involves:

Mapping the data onto the data model 
Cleaning and modifying the dataset if developed by others

## Step 3: Design The Algorithm

We used code to actually build it and accomplish this task. 

## Step 4: Design a Small Website for the Project

Create a small website using HTML and CSS to contextualize the algorithm. Including information about the project, dataset, algorithm, your team, and the division of labor.

## Step 5: Publish The Dataset, Algorithm, and Website on GitHub

Bundle all the work from Steps 2 to 4 into a single repository and publish it on GitHub. 
Make the website publicly accessible using GitHub Pages.
