# Datalogical Thinking Project Group 4
Welcome to our project repository! This project aims to guide you through the process of conceptualizing, curating a dataset, designing an algorithm, and creating a small website to showcase our work. 

## Step 1: Conceptualization

The first step was to brainstorm with the team and decide what kind of data we're interested in and what we want to do with it. 

This included:

Finding or conceptualizing an interesting dataset
Defining a specific problem or need for the data that can be resolved algorithmically
Modeling or fine-tuning the data to make it relevant for your algorithm

We decided to use a dataset inlcuding course literature. 

## Step 2: Curate The Dataset

This step involved:

Mapping the data onto the data model 
Cleaning and modifying the dataset

## Step 3: Design The Algorithm

We used Java Script to actually build the algorithm and embedded it into the website. 

## Step 4: Design a Small Website for the Project

We created a small website using HTML and CSS to contextualize the algorithm. 
Including information about the project, dataset, algorithm, team, and the division of labor.

## Step 5: Publish The Dataset, Algorithm, and Website on GitHub

We bundled all the work from Steps 2 to 4 into a single repository and published it on GitHub. 
The website is publicly accessible by GitHub Pages.
