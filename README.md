# Datalogical Thinking Project Group 4
This GitHub Page serves our representation for the assignment. 

## About the Assignment
For this assignments, students work together in a group to curate 
a dataset, and use pseudocode to design an algorithm to process that dataset in a meaningful way. Students are asked to publish their dataset and algorithm on GitHub, alongside a simple website with some basic information on their project, dataset, and algorithm -- to be hosted using GitHub Pages. Students can use this template as a starting point to organize their GitHub repositories.
